This are basic learning examples of ASM (MIPS) - MARS

v1 Printing a String.asm
---This is a first example just printing out 'HELLO WORLD' which is the start of everything

v2 Printing a Character.asm
---This example shows printing a single character
---It is different from printing string in terms of size

v3 Printing an Integer.asm
---This example shows printing an Integer

v4 Printing a Float.asm
---This is an example printing PI which as a float

v5 Printing a Double.asm
---This is an example printing PI which as a double

v6 Adding Integers.asm
---This example adds two integers and prints out the result

v7 Subtracting Integers.asm
---This is an example of subtraction between integers and prints out the result

v8 Multiplicating Integers using mul.asm
---This example multiplying two integers using the 'mul' function and prints out the result

v9 Multiplicating Integers using mult.asm
---This example multiplying two integers using the 'mult' function and prints out the result

v10 Dividing Integers without Overflow.asm
---This example dividing two integers without holding an overflow and prints out the result

v11 Dividing Integers with Overflow.asm
---This example dividing two integers holding an overflow and can print out the result, reminder

v12 User Input Integer.asm
---This example prompts the user's age and prints it out as a formatted string

v13 User Input Float.asm
---This example prompts the user's weight and prints it out as a formatted string

v14 User Input Double.asm
---This example prompts the user's weight as a double and prints it out as a formatted string

v15 User Input String.asm
---This example prompts the user's name and prints it out as a formatted string
